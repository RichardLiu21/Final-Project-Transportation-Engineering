# Final-Project-Transportation-Engineering
This will be my final project for CE-UY 3013 Spring 2021

This project helps to facilitate the economic analysis of different alternatives in transportation engineering. With the aid of different factors to "move" costs around, different methods can be employed to determine which alternative is the best.
